The player takes the role of Zagreus, the prince of the Underworld, who is trying to escape the realm to get away from his dispassionate father, Hades, and reach Mount Olympus. His quest is supported by the other Olympians, who grant him gifts to help fight through the beings that protect the exit from the Underworld. The game is presented in an isometric view with the player in control of Zagreus. The player starts a run-through of the game by trying to fight their way through several rooms; the room layouts are pre-determined, but their order and the enemies that appear are randomly determined. The player has a primary weapon, a special attack, and a magic spell which they can use to take out enemies. Sometimes on clearing a room, one of the Olympians will provide a gift, a choice of three persistent boosts for that run that the player can select from; the gifts are themed based on the Olympian, for example with Zeus providing lightning damage effects. The player also collects in-game currency and potentially keys. Should Zagreus' health points drop to zero, he \"dies\" and ends back up facing his father, removing all gifts granted from the last run. In this area, before settling on a new quest, the player can use the currency to unlock permanent upgrades for Zagreus, or the keys to unlock different weapons.",

The player controls a young boy and it starts with no context as he climbs down a rock at night in a dark forest. There are no conversations or explanations in the game, but the events reveal it is set in a dystopian universe where sinister experiments are performed on humans or human-like creatures. As in Limbo the boy needs to solve environment based puzzles, hide from people and animals, escape in chase sequences and complete sections with platform mechanics. The boy moves in a hostile environment and cannot be spotted, but it is not explained if he escaped or deliberately seeks out the mystery. There is no HUD and controls are limited to movement, jumping, and grabbing objects to operate them or to move them around. Progress often involves trial and error to test different options as every challenge usually requires a new approach. He dies often and at times in gruesome ways. The boy can operate elevators, climb or swing from chains and ropes, swim underwater, operate a tiny submarine and so on. There is also a mechanic involving mind control to control other characters. Later on in the game a small group of characters can be gathered and they follow him around automatically. They can help him lift doors or push objects, or throw him in the air. There are no hints, so the player always needs to figure out what to do and where to go. Similar to Limbo the game has a dark environment, but here with sparse use of colour. Checkpoints are activated automatically and chapters can be revisited at any moment using a menu. Optionally certain hidden objects can be located and disabled, along with an alternate ending to discover. There is a lot of suspense and tense moments in the game, but also scenes that focus entirely on solving a puzzle with no pressure. More",

    "description": "Earth has fallen The year is 2054. Earth has been destroyed by an intergalactic war between two alien races, and humanity is on the brink of annihilation. A small number of survivors, aboard the USS White Whale, crash land on the vast and untamed planet Mira. Now, it falls to you, as a member of BLADE, to help bring humanity back from the edge of extinction…with the aid of powerful giant robots called Skells. Combat basic training Choose from a huge variety of special attacks, skills, and classes in a combat system that’s as deep as you want it to be. Standard attacks: During battle, you'll auto-attack with your ranged and melee weapons as you await the right time to use powerful and tactical attacks. Using arts: Arts are special abilities that can do major damage and can even have special effects under certain conditions. Arts need a cooldown period after use before they're available again, so timing is key. Some attacks may inflict status changes to your opponent if you hit them from the front, side, or back. Keep your positioning in mind before unleashing Arts to make the most of their might. Soul Challenge: These timing-based challenges pop up during battle from time to time. If you successfully time your button press, you’ll increase party morale and give your party a small boost. Soul Voice: When a teammate uses a battle cry, select a corresponding Art to create a party combo. Not only will you do more damage, you'll replenish your party's health and may give temporary stat boosts. Overdrive: A special technique that enhances combat abilities for a certain duration. When activated on foot, you'll inflict a large amount of damage to all enemies in battle. The damage you deal is also increased, while enemy debuff resistance is lowered. Pilot powerful Skells Once you’ve proven yourself, you’ll earn the right to pilot and personalize your very own Skell—a powerful machine that can fly, transform into a vehicle for faster overland travel, and wield immense strength in combat with customizable weapons and armor. With three weight classes and a ton of weapon attachments to choose from, a well-tinkered Skell can give you the edge you need. A massive world full of surprises Discover bizarre and beautiful plants, animals, and landscapes on your journey across planet Mira. Map new areas, collect resources, and try to locate fellow survivors as humanity builds New Los Angeles. PLANET MIRA >>>> New Los Angeles: Your colonization ship, the USS White Whale, contained the city of New Los Angeles. Luckily, it survived the ship’s crash landing to become the first (and only) city on Mira. PLANET MIRA >>>> Primordia: The continent where New Los Angeles is located, Primordia is a diverse region featuring grasslands, mountains, and large bodies of water. PLANET MIRA >>>> Noctilum: A lush, green continent. Its forests and swamps are often lit at night with the eerie glow of insects and giant, luminescent plants. PLANET MIRA >>>> Oblivia: Features a desert-like landscape and hulking structures that appear to be what’s left of an alien outpost. Beware of sandstorms. PLANET MIRA >>>> Sylvalum: A continent with a strange, bleached-out landscape punctuated with jutting, pollen-filled plants. The wildlife here seems to be particularly powerful. PLANET MIRA >>>> Cauldros: This volcanic region is a treacherous land of lava and black metal. It's also home to hostile alien bases, so tread carefully. Assemble your crew Recruit party members to your cause from a memorable cast of characters. Each companion has different combat and support skills to offer. You can customize their gear, weapons, and more at any time. Your Character Choose your avatar's main features, then customize your appearance from head to toe. As you play, you'll get access to new armor, clothing, and weapon options that'll also update your look. Elma: The first person you meet. A former colonel, she's now a Reclaimer and a powerful ally. Her combat skills are unmatched. Lin: She may be young, but this mechanical genius knows all about Skells and her enthusiasm is infectious. Lao: Considered the best marksman on Mira. He may seem calm and cool to observers, but conflicting emotions rage below the surface. Tatsu: Tatsu is a Nopon, an alien species indigenous to Mira. Once you rescue him from a dangerous situation, he seems determined to stick around. Vandham: Commander of BLADE, the military organization responsible for protecting New Los Angeles. Nagi: The former captain of the USS White Whale that crashed onto Mira. Now, he oversees the provisional government of New Los Angeles. Squad up to work together online Once you have enough experience, you can join an online* squad of up to 32 players to take on multiplayer missions. Squad members can recruit each other’s avatars to their parties, share information, give and receive gear or items, and team up for missions or battles. Assemble your squad: Jump into a Quick Assignment to join a squad with random players that match your level, choose to Play with Friends in a public match, or create an exclusive Private Squad. Squad Tasks: Take on a tally of hunting-and-gathering objectives alongside a squad of up to 32 players. Complete tasks to earn reward tickets and unlock co-op Squad Missions. Squad Missions: Up to four players can work together on special assignments. Complete these to earn in-game rewards. Global Nemesis Battles: Up to four players square off against ultra-powerful creatures. The challenge may be great, but the rewards are worth the risk. Give it your all! More games. More features. More fun. Nintendo Switch Online members can access online play in compatible games (including this one), a library of classic games, special offers, and more.

Players have access to a variety of weapons, each with unique playstyles and abilities, to use in battle against the monsters.

    "description": "Balatro is a strategic card game with a roguelike structure influenced by the Cantonese card game Big Two and Luck be a Landlord. A game is played as a run that is different every time because of various parameters and random elements. It is up to the player to organize and enhance a standard deck of 52 cards to complete the run, which ends the game. During runs various elements are unlocked permanently, but as is typical for a roguelike, most of the items and progress are lost as soon as the run is over, whether it was completed successfully or not. A run is divided into multiple steps called Blinds with a limited number of hands. If a Blind cannot be completed because the requirements are not met, the game is over right away. Scoring in the game is based around the standard hands of the Poker such as a high card, a pair, a flush or a full house. There are however a lot of game elements that add to the strategy. There is a cash system where money between Blinds can be spent on new cards and card modifications. For instance, both individual cards and hands can be upgraded, making a pair earn more than a straight. The standard deck can contain enhanced cards of various types, but players can also destroy cards, removing them permanently, or introduce new cards. That way, it is for instance possible to get rid of some Jacks and replace them with additional aces instead. Unlike as is common in most deck building games, it is possible to run out of cards in a single Blind when all of them have been dealt. Other game elements are Joker cards that provide bonuses and multipliers and single-use tarot cards that can be used at specific moments for a strategic advantage. In the third and final Blind of a round the player is often challenged to work around certain restrictions, such as hidden cards, debuffed cards or only allowing a specific hand to be played. The roguelike structure is further deepened by unlocking specific starting decks and multiple difficulties. Many game elements are also only unlocked over time, as more Joker cards are added to the starting pool. More",

    "description": "Years after a devastating war between humans and monsters, a child has fallen through a hole and into the monsters' underground world. Under the care of a kindly monster woman named Toriel, they learn the basics of the underground world, including that they may be attacked by other monsters who are less friendly. After the child leave's Toriel's care, it's up to them how they proceed through the underground, including whether they kill the monsters in their way or try to find peaceful resolutions to conflict. Undertale is an Eastern RPG with some action aspects in its combat system. In the overworld, the player explores areas, solves puzzles, and talks to NPCs. When a battle is triggered, typically through random encounter, the game switches to the combat screen. A heart representing the child's soul appears in a small box, in which objects representing the monsters' attacks appear and must be dodged in real time. On the child's turn, they can attack monsters more directly through the fight command. A meter that determines the strength of the player's attack must be hit with good timing in order to deal more damage. Alternatively, players may choose to perform friendly actions in battle or show mercy to the opponent in order to resolve conflict without bloodshed. It is possible to finish every encounter in the game without killing anyone, though some monsters are more difficult to do this with than others. The player may need to perform certain actions in the overworld before some monsters can be befriended. Although only one Undertale save file can be kept at a time, the game remembers certain player actions across playthroughs, mainly in reference to how violent or peaceful they were. Resetting to an earlier save or starting a new game after specific actions are taken can affect how some NPCs treat the player and how the story is ultimately resolved. More",

    "description": "Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition is a remake of the original Xenoblade Chronicles with updated graphics and a somewhat different art style. Changes in content are minimal, and mostly consist of quality of life features such as difficulty settings, an improved quest tracker, and fashion gear. New content includes a time trials mode and a handful of new equipment sets. Definitive Edition also includes a brand-new epilogue chapter, Future Connected, which can be accessed at any time independent of progress in the main game. One year after the events of the original game, Shulk and Melia set off for the imperial city of Alcamoth, of which the latter is crown princess. However, a malevolent, incorporeal being called the Fog King has appeared in the city from a rift in space-time and driven the residents to the Bionis' Shoulder. Tensions between the survivors have fractured their community, leaving them with little hope of ever returning to their homeland. Melia takes it upon herself to reunite her people and retake the capital, and in the process prove her worth as heir to the throne. Shulk and Melia are joined in their quest by a pair of Nopon named Nene and Kino, children of Riki who wish to follow in their father's footsteps and become heroes. The party are also able to recruit the Ponspectors, a Nopon survey crew who offer their assistance in battle. In addition to randomly jumping in to use special skills, the Ponspectors can combine their power to launch an all-out attack against the enemy. Other mechanics from the main game have been streamlined or removed to better fit the shorter campaign.",

    "description": "Return to Monkey Island is a point-and-click adventure and a direct sequel to Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge (1991). It has the original creator Ron Gilbert back at the helm and picks up directly after the events of that game. However, it also incorporates and acknowledges the characters and events from later titles such as The Curse of Monkey Island (1997), Escape from Monkey Island (2000) and Tales of Monkey Island (2009). This game focuses on the series' protagonist Guybrush Threepwood as he sets out to finally reveal the secret of the Monkey Island. A short prelude explains the ending of the previous game, why this title is told as a flashback and an optional scrapbook available in the main menu is provided with a brief history of the events of all games. The adventure is divided in several parts and starts on Mêlée Island where Guybrush, reprised by Dominic Amato, once again finds himself without a ship and crew to travel to Monkey Island. Mêlée island has also changed, with Carla the swordmaster as the new governor, Elaine advocating social and health issues, and a new pirate leadership refusing to fund Guybrush's venture. Many characters from all titles return in this game, such as Stan the salesman, Otis, Wally the map maker, the Voodoo Lady and Murray the talking skull, but also many new characters. Next to the familiar Monkey Island and Mêlée Island there are entirely new locations such as Brr Muda and Terror Island. A classic point-and-click interface is used to experience the story, talk to characters and solve puzzles. When hovering over a character or object, usually one or two options are provided: to examine and to interact. Items can be picked up and are stored in an inventory where they can be combined or used in the environment. There is also a todo list as an inventory item where quests are tracked. A separate action is available to highlight all hotspots in the environment. The game can be played in an easy Casual mode or the Hard more with more puzzles. There is also a separate Writer's Cut option with more text and dialogue, available for both modes. Hints are provided through another in-game item, a hint book provided by the Voodoo Lady. The environment is also littered with optional trivia cards stored in a trivia book. Players need to answer a question about the series. If it is answered incorrectly the card disappears. The game retains its humorous approach, often breaking the fourth wall. The game uses an entirely new visual style headed by Rex Crowle and similar to the one used in his game Knights and Bikes (2019). It aims to resemble a picture book or a pop-up book with exaggerated character features, using 2D and no longer the pixel art of the original two games or the sharp cartoon or 3D look from later titles. The original composers also return with new music. More",

Since the game is an otome, players take on the role of Kisa Tachibana, a female who is forced to hide her identity in the all-men’s school. Tachibana hopes to re-kindle her passion for the theater by attending the opera school. Most of the game’s focus is on Tachibana’s participation in the final and most important show of the year, all the while trying to keep her identity a secret. Jack Jeanne focuses on Tachibana’s efforts to achieve what is called a “Quartz”, which is basically the top-ranking spot in every theater class. The game’s title derives upon the characters’ stage names; men who play a male role are referred to as Jack, while men who play a female role are referred to as Jeanne. The gameplay revolves around on two parts: the simulation aspects, in which you strengthen your bond with your classmates as the protagonist Tachibana and follows her story into the game; and the rhythm aspects, which are just the shows that the students perform while dancing in full 3D.",

    "description": "Kaname Date is a detective working for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, who lost his memories and left eye after an incident six years ago. Assisting him in his police work is Aiba, an advanced AI housed in his prosthetic eye. In addition to normal detective activities such as examining crime scenes and gathering testimonies, Date and Aiba are able to dive into a person's dream world, or Somnium, in order to uncover the truth a subject's conscious self can't or won't reveal. Date's newest investigation focuses on the death of a woman named Shoko Nadami, whose corpse was discovered with her left eye missing. As more bodies are discovered, each missing the left eye, it becomes apparent that they are the work of a serial killer dubbed the New Cyclops Killer. The more Date digs into the increasingly-complex case, the more it seems that it may have some connection to his missing memories and the Original Cyclops Serial Killings of six years ago... Gameplay is divided into real world and Somnium segments. In the real world, Date examines crime scenes and talks to persons of interest in a point-and-click format. When normal human vision is insufficient, Aiba's special vision modes can be used to examine the environment. Violent confrontations play out as quick time events in which Aiba runs simulations to guide Date through the fight safely. In Somnium, the player directly controls Aiba in a subject's dream. Although there is a strict time limit of six real-world minutes, the perception of time is different in a dream. Thus, instead of having to contend with a constantly ticking clock, each action the player performs will shave a different amount of time off of the 360-second total, and players are given limited opportunities to change the length of time an action will take. By interacting with objects and solving puzzles based on dream logic, Aiba can break a subject's mental locks and uncover the truth. Certain Somnia have multiple solutions, which will send the player down different story paths. Only by playing every path can the case be fully solved. More",

Just like the original game it is played in a large arena with two teams of cars. As with football the goal is to score by launching a giant ball into the goal of the opposing team. The arena has curved edges with large walls, so the ball cannot leave the pitch and bounces back, and it is possible to drive up the sides. Cars have no means of attack and no health bar, but it is possible to ram other cars to hinder them. Vehicles also have the ability to jump and use nitro. Nitro boosts are limited, but can be refilled by driving over certain sections of the pitch. By winning matches experience is earned to level up and unlock new parts. The car can be fully customized in a garage with different types of bodies, colours, wheels, decals, nitro trails etc. which is new for this version. Next to one-time exhibition matches and online games, it has a full season mode. The player sets up a season and determines the length (number of weeks), difficulty (rookie, pro, all-star), play-offs and the team size, with multiple matches in succession. Matches generally last five minutes. The game supports both offline (split-screen for up to four players) and online multiplayer. Matches can be played with two to up to eight players and online games support both ranked and unranked playlists. Multiplayer is platform independent. When playing alone team mates are controlled by the AI. The tutorial consists of several mini-games based on three categories: defence, offence, and aerial play. While playing a small arrow shows the location of the ball when it is in the air and the camera can be rotated around the car to keep track of the action. After scoring the ball is returned to the middle and the cars are flown back to their side of the pitch. More",

    "description": "The 2019 Switch version of The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening is a remastered/re-rendered version of the 1993 Game Boy version using partial elements from the 1998 Game Boy Color (DX) version. The general consensus of the story and it’s plot-line still remain true to the original and have been slightly changed in some places with additions/removals of various non-significant elements which don’t hold up in the Switch version, when compared to the originals. Besides the complete graphical and sound/music overhaul to represent a \"clay-like motion\" feel to the game, it's gameplay controls have been changed to incorporate the additional buttons the Switch holds as opposed to the 2-button choice of the Game Boy. In the original, Link had to change his equipment depending his situation, setting them to the A and B buttons on the fly. The Switch version automatically assigns the Sword and Shield to pre-allocated buttons, whilst the other buttons can be designated to the other in-game items at the user’s preferences. The graphical limitation of the original meant the areas loaded and shifted whilst Link was traversing from one screen area to another. The Switch version area traversal progression overlaps when Link runs from one to another. The overworld map is far more detailed and can be zoomed in to distinguish individual rocks and trees and suspicious locations can now be marked to be returned to on a later occasion. The mini-game shop in Mabe Village, which plays a part in the trading item quest has new decorative items as prizes, which can be set at different locations all over Koholint Island. Additional heart-pieces can also be won extending the heart meter to a total of 20 instead of the 14 hearts of the original. Other new items include Fairy Bottles in which Link can now catch fairies to hold for a later time. The original quest of finding hidden seashells, which resulted in obtaining the best sword in the original, has now been made easier with the addition of the Seashell Sensor, obtained at gathering 20 shells. When equipped a ping is sent out when in the proximity of a hidden shell. The total amount of hidden seashells has been increased when compared to the ones available in the original. One other place to gather additional heart pieces is at Dampe's stone shack, located on the former place of Photographer's House from Link’s Awakening DX. Dampé hosts the newly added \"Chamber Dungeons\" in which the player can create his/her own dungeon using the pieces from dungeons one has completed already. An accompanying new released Link amiibo allows the player to save newly created dungeons to show at other people's game. When scanning this amiibo, one can also encounter \"Dark Link\" in the player's made-up dungeons. More",

Balloons serve as lives, with every hundred bananas collected awarding you one extra balloon.

Team up with the ethereal creature Tri and use the Tri Rod to create “echoes,” which are imitations of things you find in the environment—then recreate those echoes whenever you like to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. Use echoes like water blocks to reach new heights, make bridges out of old beds, throw rocks at foes, or find your own combination of echoes to do things your way. You can even make echoes of monsters to fight at your side in combat! Use a variety of abilities to conquer rifts and dungeons across a vast Hyrule To close the rifts to the Still World and save the people trapped inside, Zelda and Tri must first enter each rift. Once inside, they must use their combined powers to traverse broken terrain and dungeons with challenging bosses. You'll need more than just your echoes to get past all the obstacles in your way. Use Bind to make objects follow Zelda’s movements, or Reverse Bond to follow an object’s movements. You can also use a mysterious sword to transform into the powerful swordfighter form for a short time. With these abilities at your disposal, you’ll be fully equipped to tackle each challenge in your own way! Your search for the rifts will span far and wide and bring you into contact with plenty of folks who will make requests of you. Luckily you can use waypoints or a horse to get around! Travel off the beaten path to discover side quests and minigames As you explore Hyrule, you’ll encounter all kinds of interesting folk—those dealing with problems great and small, and even some that just want to give you a fun challenge! You’ll even meet the engineer Dampé, helping him to create automatons and use them to attack and stun enemies. Equip accessories and visit Smoothie Shops for bonus effects Try on different outfits and accessories to gain various effects such as increasing appearance of hearts or ability to jump higher. Visit a Smoothie Shop to blend up your ingredients into tasty drinks capable of replenishing your hearts and granting temporary bonuses like resistance to electricity. Scan any The Legend of Zelda™ themed amiibo™ figures* to get rewards, like smoothie ingredients and certain outfits in alternate colors. Source: Nintendo.com Description",

But history would know him as the \"Dynast-King.\" King Dorgalua strove to stamp out the hatred among the people of the isles, and for fully half a century, Valeria knew prosperity. Yet upon the king's death, civil war erupted anew as three factions vied for control: the Bakram, who comprised much of Valeria's nobility; the Galgastani, whose people made up the majority of the isles' population; and the Walister, who numbered but few. The isles were soon divided between the Bakram and Galgastani, and an uneasy peace settled across the land. Yet none believed the calm would last...

    "description": "The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is a first person exploration game. It is an expanded re-imagining of the critically acclaimed, award winning indie game The Stanley Parable from 2013. When a simple-minded individual named Stanley discovers that the co-workers in his office have mysteriously vanished, he sets off to find answers. You will play as Stanley, and you will not play as Stanley. You will make a choice, and you will have your choices taken from you. The game will end, the game will never end. Contradiction follows contradiction, the rules of how games should work are broken, then broken again. You are not here to win. The Stanley Parable is a game that plays you. What's New? Everything that was in the original Stanley Parable is here, preserved just like it was back in 2013. But The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe also dramatically expands the world of the original game with new content, new choices, and new secrets to uncover. The labyrinth has just gotten bigger. In addition, the game has been visually upgraded to reflect modern technology while faithfully preserving the tone of the original game. Accessibility features have also been added to the game, including localization of in-world text, colorblind options, and content warnings. And just as before, the impeccable voicework of Kevan Brighting will accompany you every step of the way. In The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe, everything you remember has been recreated, yet it's different somehow. We've been here before, haven't we? Is Stanley still the same as he was back then? Or is it you who has changed? Source: Steam Store Description",

Ōkami tells the tale of a wolf-goddess named Amaterasu who must prevent an evil being known as Orochi from taking over the beautiful world of feudal Japan. Ōkami takes the already well-established cell shading technique and turns it into a traditional Hokusai-style Japanese woodblock print visual. To give the player a sense of being in a painting, Amaterasu is given a paintbrush which the player can cut enemies down with, create bridges or wind, and restore the forest to its natural beauty. With each defeated enemy, color returns, and the natural life force slowly regenerates. While playing, players call up a canvas where they can draw with the celestial brush. New abilities and techniques are acquired as you progress. Ōkami is filled with large worlds and dungeons to explore on your quest to restore the lush trees and wildlife to their former glory. Many monsters and large epic boss battles come between Amaterasu and her goal. To fulfill her objective there will be many people along the way that will help her if she helps them.",

By the time Trace arrives on Sudra he finds this world and his civilization collapsed due to the release of the \"Pathogen\". With help of the Russalki (giant war machines that guard Sudra), Trace has to fight back the invading forces and return back across The Breach to Earth. The world of Sudra is an open world in which Trace can travel back and forth, but needs access to better gear and weapons to keep progressing. Several areas can be travelled to by means of opening up pathways with the items Trace can find along the way. This also involves backtracking. Such items include for instance the Modified Labcoat, Grapple, Laser Drill, Address Disruptor and Remote Drone. Some weapons can be used to open secret paths. None of the available energy based weapons consume ammo. Upgrades for health and weapons can also be found while exploring every nook and cranny. Backtracking is needed for optionally completing the game entirely, but most of the weapons that are needed to finish the game can be found in a linear playthrough. The amount of alien flora and fauna on Sudra varies from area to area. The enemies respawn after leaving the general area. After killing them they leave behind some health.",

This squid form can move quicker through these zones, although it cannot shoot like the humanoid form. The game once again combines motion controls with the analogue stick. Several new features are present, while maintaining the same gameplay elements of the original. There is a brand new single-player campaign, besides a local multiplayer mode due to the Switch’s ad-hoc functionality, both on the Switch console itself and on the TV. Besides classical weapons from the original game, like Splattershot, Ink Roller and Splat Charger, the game also presents the player with several new guns, like Splat Dualies, which allow for a wider range of fire. New special attacks are also introduced, being unlockable throughout the matches, including a rocket launcher with lock-on capabilities or a jetpack able to fire Inklings (the playable characters) into the sky and have them drop bombs. There also new maps exclusive to this game, making it larger than the original. The sequel retains the aesthetic look of the original, with an even more vibrant color scheme. This comes into play particularly during the stylistic character customization system, which is meant to have players make use of the screenshot functionality, to take pictures of their personalized Inklings and share them online.",

    "description": "## Features : RogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath. Souls-lite combat: Pattern-based bosses and minions, weapons and spells with unique gameplay. Make do with what you have and don’t forget to roll. Nonlinear progression: Unlock new levels with every death and explore undiscovered parts of the castle as you prepare for the inevitable bosses. Exploration: Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes. Death is the new backtracking. Roguelike, Rogue-lite, roguelike-like, rogueschmike! No matter what you call them, the world could always use another! As such, we'd like to present for your consideration, the illegitimate child of the roguelike and the metroidvania, the RogueVANIA. Anywho, enough with the sales pitch, let’s take a closer look. By metroidVania, we’re really talking about a fixed, hand designed, interconnected world. The game takes place on an immense island that never changes. All of the biomes, bosses and the paths between them are present right from the start. Getting to them is another story... However, in Dead Cells, death replaces the traditional backtracking mechanic of a metroidvania. At first, seemingly unreachable areas will be strewn across your path, but answers to these riddles will appear as you explore the island. Be it a key, a new acrobatic skill or a forgotten spell. Once uncovered, this knowledge will stay with you, allowing you to unlock new paths to your goal. Sick of the stinking sewers? Head over the ramparts and take a breath of fresh air! It’s your skill, playstyle and of course the loot you find that will determine your path. Furthermore, as the term \"RogueVania\" might (not so) subtly imply, we were also quite heavily influenced by the recent wave of roguelites. When there are no checkpoints to save you from your screw-ups, the adrenaline kicks in. And when you lose, you lose big, so you’ve got to make it out alive. Instead of relying on the classic formula of memorising the level design and enemy placement, procedural generation allows us to reward your instincts, reflexes and ability to adapt to evolving situations. Having said this, we’re conscious that the words “procedural generation” conjure up images of crappy levels and uninteresting gameplay in a lot of gamers’ minds. So we’ve chosen a hybrid solution, with each run being a mashup of carefully designed “chunks” of level. The idea is to give you the feeling of meticulously handcrafted world, while making sure you have a new experience every time. Don’t expect it to be a walk in the park though. Pattern based monsters and demanding boss fights will teach you to choose your battles and build your strength. Every weapon has its own unique feel and rolling and dodging will become second nature, as you learn to manage the mobs of monsters that will overwhelm the unprepared. We’re going after that “tough, but fair” feeling. Tired of the violence and death? Explore a bit, take a stroll, enjoy the view from the ramparts, find a secret room. Thomas and Gwen, our graphic artists, never miss an opportunity to impress with their pixelart and shape a world worth exploring. You might even learn a little more about the lore of the place, who knows? Source: Steam Store Description",

    "description": "1802: the merchant ship Obra Dinn becomes lost at sea. 1807: the ship drifts into port at Falmouth with no living soul on board, and all the crew and passengers dead or missing. An insurance investigator for the East India Company's London Office boards the ship in order to determine what exactly has happened. To this end, the investigator uses a magical pocketwatch called \"Memento Mortem\" which allows to view the moment of any person's death. Return of the Obra Dinn is a first-person detective game. The player's task is to determine the fate of each of the 60 people that were on board the ship. The player can explore the entire ship, from the upper to the bottom deck (although some locations are initially inaccessible). Whenever the player comes upon a corpse, he can use the Memento Mortem to view the moment of the person's death. This allows the player to hear the last few things said in the person's vicinity, and explore a time-frozen diorama that depicts the exact moment of their demise. Additionally, if the diorama includes any older visible corpses, the pocketwatch can be used to generate an illusory image of these corpses elsewhere on board, which in turn can be used to access their death scenes. In doing so, the tragedy of the Obra Dinn is slowly reconstructed, death by death. Each discovered death scene is entered into an initially blank log-book. The player's task is to fill in the identity of the deceased person, the means of their death, and (if applicable) their killer. To help in this endeavour, the log-book includes a list of names of all people on board, several group portraits, and a map of the ship; it also allows to quickly review certain details from previously seen death scenes. Determining the identities and fates of the people on board is not easy, and often requires careful consideration of the clues present in the death scenes. For instance, the player may need to identify the people's roles based on their behavior, clothing or relationships with other people. At other times, he might need to carefully examine several successive death scenes in order to reconstruct a sequence of events. Whenever three people's fates are identified correctly, the game acknowledges this and the correct information is marked as such. The game uses a graphical filter that mimics retro 1-bit graphics, such as those found in early Macintosh games. More",

In the Ark, a multi-cultural city in the near future, disaster strikes when gates to another dimension suddenly appear! Dangerous creatures begin to emerge, attacking the people and polluting the land, and normal police forces are unable to compete with them. To stand up against these threats, a brand new, special police unit known as Neuron is formed. Choose between two playable characters – one male, one female – on your adventure. The character you don’t choose also appears as your younger twin, and a fellow member of Neuron. In order to resist the creatures, humanity developed a special weapon: the Legion. The Legion acts as your partner, and helps with your investigations. However, it’s in battle where the Legion shows its real ability... Work together with the Legion and use all sorts of combat styles to fight your enemies. You could both attack the same enemy simultaneously, target different opponents, or send your Legion on the offensive while you support it with items. Use this synergetic action system to battle and explore together!

    "description": "Fifteen years after the events of Ridley Scott's Alien Ellen Ripley's daughter Amanda is looking for answers. She is an engineer working for Weiland-Yutani Corporation. When she finds out that the logs from USCSS Nostromo have been located and transported to Sevastopol space station she decides to join a small crew sent by Weiland-Yutani to retrieve the data. Little does she know that the ship that has found the logs reached Sevastopol with a terrifying passenger on board, the one that murdered the majority of station's population and left the survivors cowering in fear. Alien: Isolation is a survival horror game. It is set on the Sevastopol space station where Amanda is searching for USCSS Nostromo logs. Sevastopol is split into many areas, and a certain degree of freedom is given to the player: areas may have several alternative routes to the goal, hidden rooms and ventilation shafts; also Amanda may (and later needs to) backtrack through the station. As the game goes on Amanda's tools will be upgraded and she will be able to get access to previously out of reach areas. Amanda is an engineer, so she is able to loot containers and bodies for resources and craft devices like noisemakers, smoke bombs, or Molotov cocktails, mainly used to distract the enemy. Later she acquires a flashlight, a motion detector and several types of weapons to defend herself against humanoid enemies (groups of hostile survivors or androids). However, Amanda is not a fighter, and each encounter should be carefully planned. Many actions take some time, for example to use a medpack Amanda needs to stand perfectly still. When Amanda draws attention of the alien, stealth is the only way to survive. The alien cannot be harmed, and it kills Amanda in a single hit. In most cases it doesn't follow a predetermined scripted route, but instead relies on its senses to track Amanda down. In addition to the main story mode there's Survivor mode in which the player needs to escape from a specially designed map fulfilling secondary objectives along the way, while being aggressively hunted by the alien. This mode includes online leaderboards. More",

After that Link teams up with Fi, a spirit living within a sword and he descends to the long-forgotten surface to search for Zelda. The game is structured very similar to previous Zelda games: you travel through an overworld in search of temples to visit and once in you solve a series of puzzles before fighting a boss at the end and receive the next bit of plot.

Maybe you can attract rare Townsfolk by serving unique dishes... Crafting: There are tons of structures, decorative monuments, and furniture to craft. Often times your Townsfolk will request specific objects that they would like to be placed in their home. Make sure you gather enough building materials! Merchanting: Selling items at the Shopping District will net you large sums of Dewdrops, which is the main currency in Solemn. As you become a better Merchant, rarer items will appear for you to buy! Tarott Master: Once the Dark Wizard was defeated, all of his monsters were sealed away into Tarott Cards. Many Townsfolk collect and battle with these cards, and there is even a big competition held each year in Dirboros. Get collecting! ## Make New Friends Willow: A cheery young girl who wants to rebuild Littlewood. She found you in the middle of the forest and took care of you for 3 days while you were unconscious. She likes working with tools and is quite proficient at building things. Dalton: A ditsy boy who loves going on adventures with you. Despite his forgetfulness and silly demeanor, he actually can tell some very clever jokes. He enjoys fishing, catching bugs, and shopping for cool furniture. Lilith: A Wizard who graduated at the top of her class at Alexandria's Magical Academy. When she's not reading a book she's mixing random things together to make potions that may or may not explode. Also, she is your biggest fan. And many more! Source: Steam Store Description",

In this era—long before the events of the Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Pokémon Shining Pearl games—you can find newly discovered Pokémon like Wyrdeer, an evolution of Stantler, and new regional forms like Hisuian Growlithe, Hisuian Zorua, and Hisuian Zoroark! Along the way, uncover the mystery surrounding the Mythical Pokémon known as Arceus. Preorder for a special in-game costume and download the digital version for Heavy Balls! The Hisuian Growlithe Kimono Set and a Baneful Fox Mask will be gifted to early purchasers of the Pokémon Legends: Arceus game.

Gather precious loot, discover hidden secrets, and chat with opportunistic merchants and shopkeepers to purchase powerful items to gain an edge. The Gungeon: Enter the Gungeon – a constantly evolving bullet hell fortress that elegantly blends meticulously hand-designed rooms within a procedurally-generated labyrinth bent on destroying all that enter its walls. But beware – the Gungeon responds to even the most modest victory against its sentries and traps by raising the stakes and the challenges found within! The Cult of the Gundead: The Gungeon isn’t just traps and chasms – calm your nerves and steady your aim as you face down the gun-totting Cult of the Gundead. These disciples of the gun will stop at nothing to put down the heroes in their tracks and employ any tactics necessary to defend their temple. The Gungeoneers: Choose between one of several unlikely heroes, each burdened by a deep regret and in search of a way to change their past, no matter the cost. Filled with equal parts courage and desperation, these adventurers won’t hesitate to dive across flaming walls, roll through a wall of bullets, or take cover behind whatever is around to make it to their goal alive! The Guns: Discover and unlock scores of uniquely fantastic guns to annihilate all that oppose you in the Gungeon – each carrying their own unique tactics and ammunition. Unleash everything from the tried and true medley of missiles, lasers, and cannonballs to the bizarrely effective volley of rainbows, fish, foam darts, and bees! Yep, bees.

    "description": "Fire Emblem: Engage is a Tactical RPG in the Fire Emblem series. The game features characters both new characters and returning characters from previous titles that can be summoned through Emblem Rings. The combat is top down with 2D and 3D graphics similar to more recent console and hand-held Fire Emblem games. There are mini games such as a fishing minigame, a fitness minigame, and a wyvern riding minigame. The story centers around the country of Elyos. Alear, a divine dragon, is awoken from a one thousand year slumber to help defeat the Fell Dragon by gathering the Emblem Rings spread across Elyos. Engage features characters and other content pulled from across past entries in the series. While previous Fire Emblem titles like Awakening feature characters pulled from titles set outside their specific world and canon as DLC or other bonus content, Engage is the first mainline series entry to directly feature characters from all preceding core titles in the central narrative since Fire Emblem Gaiden/Shadows of Valentia. Engage features a playable Avatar character, Alear. They are customizable for their name, birthday, gender, and have clothing options available in game. The game utilizes the Weapon Triangle system featured in past Fire Emblem games, which is with the traditional relationship of swords over axes, axes over lances, and lances over swords. However, this relationship is augmented by the presence of fist weapons, which have advantage over magic, bows, and daggers. After the completion of a battle, Alear may wander the battlefield, talk to allies and NPCs, and collect items in the same manner that the Somniel may be explored. Units that participated in battle may give Alear Bond Fragments depending on their contribution in the fight. Units that have not been deployed in battle recently may also give Alear a small amount of Bond Fragments while asking to consider deploying them in the future. Alear and their party may also collect Emblem Rings throughout the story which are a type of accessory that can be equipped to grant assistance and power of a spirit version of a past Fire Emblem hero. When a character has a ring equipped, they gain special stat bonuses and skills. As battle progresses, the special gauge will fill, and when full, the unit can take on an enhanced form by merging with the Emblem, which grants access to powerful combat arts. The Engaged state lasts for three turns at a time. More",

That's what the characters of the Puyo Puyo series find themselves in when a whole host of crazy characters claiming to be Tetris masters crash into the Puyoverse. And it's not only Tetris they want to play - they also claim to be pretty good at Puyo popping! Can these two brainteasers co-exist without driving each other crazy? Puyo Puyo Tetris is a combination of the Puyo Puyo and Tetris series in which the player battles through seven chapters of 10 stages each, playing as a total of 26 characters in the hopes of determining which puzzle game series is the better of the two. As usual, the objective is to score chains and drown opponents in a wave of Nuisance Puyos and/or extra blocks. But the rules change every time - one match might have the player(s) swapping between Puyo Puyo and Tetris fields, while another may allow them to use items to hinder opponents' progress. Also, at certain points, the player will encounter challenges, where the objective is to reach a certain goal before time runs out. The traditional battle mode is of course still intact, with up to 4 players battling for Puyo (or Tetris, or who knows? Maybe both) bragging rights.",

    "description": "Baba Is You is a tile-based puzzle game. The player controls (usually) a cartoonish creature named Baba, and has to get Baba to a level goal. The levels also contain various other objects (walls, rocks, doors etc.) with differing properties. The rules governing the behavior of these objects are depicted within the levels as simple sentences. For example, \"Rock is Push\" indicates that rocks can be pushed, \"Wall is Stop\" indicates that walls are impassable, and \"Baba is You\" indicates that Baba is the controllable character. However, in a twist, the words that make up these sentences are treated as physical objects in their own right, and can be pushed around to assemble new sentences and completely change the game rules. For instance, the player can disassemble the sentence \"Wall is Stop\" so that walls can be passed through freely, or assemble the sentence \"Rock is You\" to let him control the rocks. Completing each level inevitably requires skillful manipulation of the rules. As the game progresses, new words start appearing, introducing ever more complex mechanics. Often, the player must find out by experimentation the unexpected ways in which various rules can interact. \"Undo\" and \"Restart\" commands are available in case the player finds himself in an unwinnable situation.",

    "description": "Chicken Police - Paint it RED! is a narrative-driven noir adventure with a complex interrogation system and mystery-solving detective gameplay. ## KEY FEATURES: A thrilling, rich storyline with a classic film-noir twist Professional voiceover with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue! A carefully crafted, unique and \"colorful\" world A complex interrogation system 30 fully voiced characters A cinematic film-noir experience with more than 20 cutscenes! Lots of clues, information, and collectibles to find And a beautiful original soundtrack A mysterious Dame... A strange case... and the wildest cops of the Wilderness!## MEET THE CHICKEN POLICE Sonny Featherland and Marty MacChicken were once a legendary detective-duo, the Chicken Police. But that was almost a decade ago, and time had passed them by... Now, Sonny is just a semi-alcoholic wreck of a bird on his paid leave, while Marty still hides behind the facade of a star-detective. During their last case, they nearly killed each other, and they haven't spoken ever since... Now Sonny and Marty are forced to work together on a case that's weirder and wilder than anything they've ever encountered before! ## NARRATIVE-DRIVEN, DETECTIVE GAMEPLAY Chicken Police is a story-rich, dialogue-heavy adventure, combining elements of the visual novels and classic adventure games. The game has more than 30 characters to talk to, with some having to be seriously interrogated. Collect tons of clues, evidence, and highly sensitive personal information from the shady characters of Clawville to use ruthlessly against them!## EXPLORE THE CITY OF CLAWVILLE (again, and again...) There are more than 30 places to visit and some of them will change several times during the story. You can return to previous locations on several occasions to find hidden secrets, meet new characters, or gather information about the world and its inhabitants.## A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE Chicken Police has a weirdly-stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo-realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film-noir movies like The Big Sleep, Double Indemnity or Gilda and games like Grim Fandango, Policenauts, Snatcher, L.A.Noire, Aviary Attorney or the Tex Murphy series. The game was also heavily influenced by animated features like Porco Rosso, Fantastic Mr. Fox, and the series: BoJack Horseman. The noir mood is enhanced by an original musical score, backed up by professional voice acting from the studio that brought you the voices of The Wolf Among Us, Horizon Zero Dawn and Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide 2. The game is 100% voice-acted with more than 8+ hours of spoken dialogue! ## CLAWVILLE NEVER SLEEPS \"This city never sleeps - they say. Maybe that's why it is so cranky all the time.\" The city of Clawville was built as an Edenic place, where predators and prey can live in peace. But the dream remained just a dream while Clawville slowly became the darkest corner of all the Wilderness. Chicken Police is a satire, which recalls the mood and atmosphere of the 40's film-noir classics, and as the best noirs and hardboiled detective stories, it's so gritty and hopeless, that it can only be served with a lot of cynical humor... ## QUOTES ABOUT US FORBES: \"It's also clear from the trailer that its dark story will be pretty funny, with plenty of scope to establish it as one of the more unique releases in its genre. Needless to say, there'll be absolutely nothing like it released during 2020, and hopefully, it'll be as brilliant as it is different.\" DESCTRUCTOID: \"I know I mostly cover animal-based games, but few have ever stopped me dead in my tracks like this one. I mean, did you hear that song in the trailer? That's original music, baby! I'm a sucker for games with quirky themes and original music, so of course, I took notice to this one straight away. Mix that with the animals-as-people motif and spot-on detective visuals, and yeah I didn't really stand a chance.\" ROCK PAPER SHOTGUN: \"Fortunately I’m batting my jet-lagged eyes at Chicken Police, an upcoming noir detective adventure with grizzled chickens and a very good raccoon. It’s a point and clicker, which means I’ll almost certainly never play it. But I’d still like you to revel in this trailer with me. It’s a cinematographic masterpiece.\" ALPHA BETA GAMER: \"It really nails the film noir vibe it’s going for. Meanwhile, the voice acting is excellent throughout, the story is interesting and the writing is very witty, packed full of cynical humor and animal-based puns. A ridiculous and riveting hardboiled detective adventure that will give you a clucking good time.\" Source: Steam Store Description",

During that time new nightmares have appeared in the world and the Magician (who was defeated in Rayman Origins) has been split into five dark teensies. These nightmares and dark teensies have captured the princesses of the land (including a new playable character Barbara) and other teensies. Naturally, Rayman and his friends are awoken once again to right the wrongs. Rayman Legends retains the graphical style and most gameplay elements of Rayman Origins. Up to four players can simultaneously progress through side-scrolling levels defeating enemies and collecting Lums. On each level, there is a number of teensies to rescue and that opens up new levels and worlds. All the powers from the previous game (wall-running, air gliding, etc.) are available to the characters from the start, but some new gimmicks are added, for example, the ability to fire projectiles on some levels. Murfy the greenbottle appears on some levels to aid the players. With a press of a button, he operates machinery, pokes bigger enemies, and opens up passages for the characters. In some versions of the game, the fifth player can control Murphy's movement. The game includes regular side-scrolling levels, \"invaded\" versions of levels that need to be completed as quickly as possible and rhythm-based levels with a soundtrack consisting of humorous covers of popular songs. In addition, forty remastered levels from Rayman Origins can be unlocked by collecting Lucky tickets. The game offers daily and weekly challenges and a local multiplayer soccer mini-game titled Kung Foot. More",

    "description": "Unpacking is a game about unpacking items and fitting them in a new location after moving. Starting in 1997, each level offers a new location and a new period in the protagonist's life as they move to a new environment with eight periods in total. It always starts with one or multiple empty rooms filled with cardboard boxes. A single bedroom at first, players eventually need to unpack for an entire house with many rooms. Selecting the cardboard box changes the cursor into an object lifted from inside. It can then be placed in the room, such as inside cabinets, on top of a shelf on a desk etc. The box disappears automatically when there are no more items inside. Most items can be put anywhere, but after everything is unpacked incorrect placements are highlighted in red. For instance: a toothbrush cannot be stored on a desk, but needs to be placed in the bathroom. There is some freedom and there is no time pressure, but only when all items are in a correct location is the environment completed. Because there are many objects that need a location, there is some puzzling involved to make everything fit. Items from boxes are not always in the correct environment, so the player needs to move them between rooms. It is possible to move between rooms at any time, as well as zooming and scrolling, for instance to get a good look at a specific object. Some items can be stacked. It is also possible to rotate objects and sometimes this is done automatically, for instance when moving a rolled up poster towards a wall so it can be hung. After a level is completed pictures (screenshots) can be taken and it is possible to decorate them as well as apply filters. The sped up version of the unpacking process can be viewed again through an animation or a GIF.",

    "description": "To the Moon is the first game in a planned series about two scientists, Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts, who specialise in a peculiar field. They practise a technology that allows them to alter people's memories. People who hire them can thus have them change their life, but only in their memory, erasing mistakes and guilt, and fulfilling unrealized potential. When patients wake up, they remember a life they never lived or forgot about regrets. In this particular story Eva and Neil visit an old man called Johnny who is already in a coma. He lost his wife River some years ago and his life wish was to go to the moon. Neil and Eva enter his dying mind – time is running out – to weave new memories; to make him remember having become an astronaut and having travelled to the moon. Even though the game is made with RPG Maker XP, the gameplay is much closer to a visual novel, along with some puzzle elements from the adventure genre. It largely consists of a series of conversations, with an entirely linear story and no ability to deviate. To create the new memory, Eva and Neil need to travel back into the patient's memory as far as necessary to introduce the needed sparks and to let it unfold. Initially they only have access to the most recent memories and they need to trace back a way into the man's youth in different phases. This is done by establishing memory links. By reliving the man's life in a reversed order – overhearing conversations and exploring the locations – orbs are collected that can be put into a memento. Once activated, a small puzzle needs to be solved to gain access to an earlier life period. Because of the reversed chronology in storytelling, the causes for consequences are only revealed afterwards. Strange occurrences such as origami rabbits all over the house and River's fascination for a lighthouse and a toy platypus are only revealed gradually as the scientists travel back farther. They can walk around freely inside the memory, freeze characters, and introduce changes. None of these are influenced by the player however. The player's input is limited to free exploration, examining objects, and triggering the events that continue the story. Characters that are not remembered by the patient are shown as vague outlines. Near the end of the game additional gameplay options are opened up, including horseback riding and a number of action sequences. The doctors have access to a menu screen where notes, items, and information about characters are stored. More",

The people of this world live on the backs of the Titans alongside Blades, weaponized life forms who are awakened from crystals and bonded to their summoner until either dies. The protagonist of this game is a boy named Rex, who lives on the back of a Titan he calls Gramps and makes his living by salvaging ancient treasures that have sunk below the clouds. When a salvaging job goes awry, Rex finds himself bonded to Pyra, a legendary Blade called the Aegis. In return for saving his life, Rex promises Pyra to take her home to Elysium, a fabled promised land atop the World Tree. Not only does he want to honor Pyra's wishes, but Rex also hopes Elysium will provide a home to the people of Alrest as the Titans grow old and die. However, Pyra's power and place in Alrest's legends and history mean several factions hope to take control of her. Rex, Pyra, and their allies will have to face those who wish to steal her away, including a terrorist organization called Torna with particularly nefarious reasons for seeking the Aegis' power. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is an action RPG set in an open world. The player's party consists of Drivers, who can be directly controlled, and the summoned Blades that grant their Drivers weapons and powers. The active party can contain up to three Drivers at a time, who in turn may engage up to three active Blades. During combat, each Driver can have one active Blade at a time, but may switch to either of the others as needed. Each Blade has their own weapon type, element, role in battle, and each grants a specific stat bonus to their Driver. In turn, Drivers have stat distributions that make them more suited towards certain weapons and Blade roles. Therefore, the player is responsible for assigning Blades that have synergy with both their Driver's specialty and the elemental distribution of the party's other Blades. Both types of character have skill trees and may equip items to further develop their strengths. Most Blades are randomly summoned from Core Crystals, which can be earned from quests, dropped from defeated enemies, or hidden within treasure chests. Others, such as Pyra, are bonded to a specific Driver over the course of the story and usually cannot be disengaged. Lastly, some Blades come from unique Core Crystals that can only be earned from sidequests. Randomly summoned Blades can either be weak, generic types, or rare ones with a unique appearance and developed personality. The latter group have better stats, more complex skill trees, and unique sidequests. All Blades may be sent on Mercenary Missions, which run in the background and allow disengaged Blades to develop their skill trees and bring back items for the party. The world consists of both wilderness, where monsters roam, and towns that house shops and other facilities. While exploring, players may encounter points of interest such as obstacles or item gathering spots; any of the party's currently engaged Blades, whether or not their Driver is part of the trio of active battlers, can use their skills to interact with these points to alter the environment or increase the yield of items earned. As the player interacts with a Titan's inhabitants by buying from shops and completing sidequests, that Titan's level of development will increase. This translates to discounts in shops and new Mercenary Missions to undertake. Some of these missions open up trade agreements between the inhabitants of different Titans, which result in the development of new items to purchase. More",

    "description": "Assault Android Cactus is a twin-stick top-down shooter set aboard the civilian space freighter Genki Star. The game starts when junior constable Cactus responds to a distress call sent three days before. When closing in, the weapon systems are suddenly activated and she boards the ship. She meets three fellow androids (Holly, Lemon and Coral) who tell her the entire robot force has started an uprising. To end it the Nexus Core needs to be brought back online so the four robot masters, the Section Lords, return to their normal state. The game takes place in dynamic arenas where just one, or up to four androids, can can work together cooperatively to clear sections to get closer to the Nexus Core. The main campaign consists of 25 stages divided into five zones. Each zone has a large boss battle at the end. The androids always face a huge resistance in waves and regularly have to fight 25 to 50 enemies at a single time. The android can be freely move around the environment and has access to a primary and a secondary weapon. The primary weapon has an unlimited amount of ammo, while the secondary and more powerful one needs some time to cool down. The key to switch between weapons also has a short dodge functionality. Defeated enemies release energy that can be collected to power up the primary weapon. Defeated enemies often leave behind power-ups such as additional firepower, faster speed, a shutdown that freezes all enemies and more. There is no regular health system. Instead, an android has a battery that drains at a constant rate. The android cannot constantly move backwards or circle while firing, as enemies regularly leave behind batteries needed to recharge, so often it is necessary to venture inside groups of enemies to retrieve it. When the battery loses all power the game is over. Taking damage can cause a temporary knock down and all power-ups for the primary weapon are lost, but the android comes back as long as there is battery energy remaining. Initially four androids are available, but eventually a total of nine can be unlocked. They all behave and control in the same way, but differ in weapons. There are regular guns, shotguns, a permanent beam, a railgun, a spinning disc etc. offering different play styles. The secondary weapons are also very different, deploying mines, rushing through groups with a drill, activating a flame thrower and so on. Enemies consist of spider-like robots, giants that launch mines, small robots that can trap android with a beam etc. with different firing patterns. Many levels have interactive elements causing the walls to change regularly or influencing movement or visibility. Some levels have turrets that can be activated to provide firing assistance. Completing areas is rewarded with credits that are used to unlock EX options, modifiers for the game, such as AI partners, psychedelic visuals or a first-person perspective. Players can also unlock sounds tests, music tracks and codex entries with information about characters, enemies and the game world. Additional unlockable game modes are the endless Infinity Drive, the Daily Drive with a new challenge each day, and a Boss Rush. More",

    "description": "Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales is a card game set in the Witcher universe. The player controls Meve, the queen of Lyria and Rivia, during the second war between the Northern Realms and Nilfgaard. Those events happened in parallel to the book saga and therefore before the video game series. While traveling through the current location, the player directly controls Meve on the overhead map. The way to the next plot point is fairly linear, but there are often side paths to take which leads to optional combat encounters or resources (recruits, wood or money) to pick up. These are used to craft additional cards or purchase upgrades. The representation of plot and dialogue depends on the importance of the encounter: decisions which only affect resources in the short run are directly displayed over the overhead map, more important ones are narrated text with illustrations and the most important ones feature animated side-view drawings of the characters. Those decisions often have significant impact on the later plot, including which characters join or leave Meve. The combat system is based on the Gwent mini game featured in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. A standard battle consists of up to three rounds where both opponents plays one of their card in turn. The hit points of all played cards are added up and whoever has the most points after one player passes, wins the round. Two winning points (draws rewards one point to both) wins the battle. At the start of a round, twelve cards are drawn from the card pool; only those can be used during the active round. After a round, the used cards are removed the playfield, the opponents draw additional ones from the pool and the next round begins. The tactical component comes from the abilities each card possesses. For example, a card may damage enemy cards when deployed, strengthen allies or draw additional cards. While most abilities are automatically triggered after deployment, others have to be manually triggered. Gold units, representing Meve's companions, have especially powerful abilities. The leaders of the two enemy groups, on player side almost always Meve, are outside of the playfield and also have a manually triggered ability (Meve acquires multiple abilities during the game, but only one can be equipped at a time). Other special card types are trinkets (applies buffs or debuffs to all or some cards when played) and one trophy (this card is always active and can't be targeted, basically a permanent buff or debuff). Besides standard battles, many fights have special gimmicks. There may be one-round fights, special requirements to fulfill (e.g. certain cards have to be protected or destroyed) or unique cards. The puzzle encounters, with few exceptions optional, feature a fixed set of cards which have to be used to solve the assignment at hand. This is a singleplayer game, but golden chests found on the overhead map include avatars or cards which can only be used in the multiplayer version Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. More",

    "description": "## Welcome to the Hospital It's the summer of 1978, and Casey Beaumaris is trying to make the most of her holidays, when her mum asks her to spend a long weekend helping out at the airborne hospital where she works. Casey prefers the company of books to people, but she agrees, secretly planning to write an article about her visit for the school newspaper. With her trusty notebook at the ready, Casey arrives on board the airship. The staff are overworked as they prepare for the visit of an important official, while the patients react to grief, or deal with active trauma. In the midst of these and many other interlocking and overlapping stories, Casey spends time with the patients, learning about their lives, and, as the stories unfold, discovering what she can do to help. ## Explore A Living World Within the world of Wayward Strand, time passes for everyone - characters continue their lives without waiting for you to interact with them. In Wayward Strand’s unique narrative structure, the stories of over a dozen characters constantly unfold around you in real time, as you, as Casey, roam freely throughout each day. Choose which story to be a part of by following people, having conversations, and exploring the hospital. The hospital’s residents are an eclectic cast of characters – some charming, some eccentric, some rude – each with their own desires, goals and imaginations. Every character moves and acts of their own accord, at their own pace, on their own timeline - sharing news with each other, arguing, joking, gossiping - or having a chat with Casey when she comes by. Every playthrough gives you the opportunity to discover something you didn’t see previously - what you missed the first time, you might see the second, third, or fifth time around. ## Your Journey When you see someone, you can follow them, to see where they go and what they get up to. You can eavesdrop on peoples’ conversations, or come into the room and be a part of the discussion. Spending time with particular characters will lead you to new storylines, locations, revelations and resolutions. As the journalist for her school newspaper, Casey keeps track of events and information in her notebook. Players use Casey’s notebook to delve deeper into peoples’ stories, to make new discoveries, and to piece together mysteries. Voice & Screen Language: English Source: Steam Store Description",
